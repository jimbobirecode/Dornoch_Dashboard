/**
 * The Club Vero handover, as rules rather than as a network call.
 *
 * The post-play email already goes to every guest a couple of days after they
 * play, and it already asks them how it went. What it could not do is keep the
 * answer: a reply lands in an inbox, and nothing counts it, scores it, or tells
 * anyone the same complaint has now arrived three times.
 *
 * Club Vero does all of that, so the two are joined at the one moment they are
 * both about: the send. Before the email goes out this dashboard hands the
 * round to Vero, Vero mints a survey for it, and the link comes back as a merge
 * field the template drops in. The guest still gets one email, from the club,
 * in the club's own voice — and the answer lands somewhere that can act on it.
 *
 * Everything here is pure, for the same reason `email-domain.js` is: the
 * decisions worth being sure about — is it configured, which campaigns does it
 * apply to, what exactly is sent about a guest — should be readable and
 * testable without an API key or a running Vero.

 * email campaigns behave exactly as they did before it existed. That is the
