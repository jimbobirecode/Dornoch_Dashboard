/**
 * The club profile, API side — the server's half of what `club_config.py`
 * holds for the Streamlit dashboard and `web/src/lib/brand.js` for the SPA.
 *
 * Only the values the API itself needs live here: how money and dates are
 * spelled in outgoing email, and the names a guest sees on it.
 *
 * Every name is overridable from the environment, because one deployment of
 * this dashboard now serves whichever club it is pointed at. The defaults are
 * TeeMail's own, so an install that sets nothing is branded rather than blank.
