 * The waitlist: who is waiting for a tee time, and what became of them.

 * satisfy at the moment it arrived, so every entry has exactly one honest
 * ending: it became a booking, it went away, or it is still open. Conversion
 * is measured against the entries that have *finished*, because an entry still
 * waiting has not failed to convert — it simply has not answered yet, and
